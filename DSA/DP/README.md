# Dynamic Programming:

## 1-D Identification:
The problems generally are in this fashion:
- Count the total number of ways
- Multiple ways of doing something then give Min/max output.
    
### Trick:
- Try to represent the problem in terms of index
- Do all possible stuff on that index according to problem statement
- If count is needed: 
    - Count all stuffs
- If Min/Max is needed
    - Min/Max(stuff)
