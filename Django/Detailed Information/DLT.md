# Django Language Template:
## Variables:
- Variables look like this: `{{variable}}`
- When the template engine encounters a variable, it evaluates that variable and replaces it with the result.
#### Rules:-
- Variable names consist of any combination of alphanumeric characters and the underscore.
- Variable name should not start with underscore.
- Variable name can not have spaces or punctuation characters.
