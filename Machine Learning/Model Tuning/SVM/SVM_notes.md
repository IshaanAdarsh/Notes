## Dataset:

- Red dots are not obese mice
- Green Dots are obese mice

### Maximum Margin Classifiers:

- We focus on the obersvations at the adges of each cluster, we draw a line at the middle (maximum margin)
  - Left of the MMC is not obese
  - Right of the MMC is obese
- The MMC are super sensitive to outlier in training data (not ideal)

#### Margin:
- The shortest distance between the observations and the threshold is called margin.
