# Confusion Marix:
- The confusion matrix is a matrix used to determine the performance of the classification models for a given set of test data. 
- The Size of the confusion Matrix is determined by the number of things we want to predict

## Properties:
- The **Rows** in a confusion Matrix shows what the ML algorithm predicted
- The **Columns** in a confusion Marix correspond to the known truth (true values for test data)
- False and True box's:
  - True Positives
  - True Negatives
  - False Positives
  - False Negatives

## Insights from the Matrix:
- The numbers along the diagonal **(Green Boxes)** tells us about how many time the samples were correctly classified
- The numbers not along the diagonal **(Red Boxes)** are samples the algorithm messed up
