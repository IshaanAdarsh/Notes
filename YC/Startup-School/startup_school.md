## Should You Start A Startup?

**Need to be resilient:**
  - Being supremely confident is different (it helps), but resilience is more about being brave but to believe in your product or service even after facing criticism.

**Need enduring motivation:**
  - This can be achieved by working on a problem you are genuinely interested in and love the people you are working with. 

_"It's better to make a product that a few people really love than one a lot of people are indifferent towards."_

### What do I have to lose? 
Image the worst case scenario which can happen if you start-up, and decide if you live with that. You will need a year’s worth of data to understand if the start-up you are working on is promising.

But you will learn a lot when starting a new company, new connections and new perspective. This also shows that you can lead people and is very helpful in future career prospects. Need to do sales, product and customer support all at once. This can help you in identifying what work you enjoy and which field suits you.

### Identifying the startup idea:
First look for a co-founder who you can debate with and have a good rapport, then fleshout your fuzzy thoughts into proper ideas about the direction you want to take. Then you can turn these ideas into side projects -> “It will be cool if someone build X”. Then try to build X. If X can elicit a positive response in someone and it makes them change their way of going about their routine, you might be on to something.

## [Prepare yourself to start a startup:](http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html)
### Counterintuitive:
- Startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot of mistakes. Partners give counterintuitive ideas: they contradict your intuitions, which help you avoid mistakes most of the time.
- But trust your feeling about people.

_“If you're thinking about getting involved with someone — as a cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and you have misgivings about them, trust your gut. If someone seems slippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don't ignore it.
This is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent. Work with people you genuinely like, and you've known long enough to be sure.”_

### Expertise:
The way to succeed in a startup is not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users and the problem you're solving for them.

_“making something people want”_

### Game:
Being trained for their whole lives to play such games (learning the type of questions in a test but not about the subject to get a good grade), young founders' first impulse on starting a startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new game. 

_“ starting a startup is where gaming the system stops working.”_


### All-Consuming:
If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine. It never gets any easier. The nature of the problems change. But the total volume of worry never decreases; if anything it increases.

### Try:
If you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably shouldn't do it. But if you're merely unsure whether you're up to it, the only way to find out is to try. Just not now.

### Ideas:
There are only two things you need initially: an idea and cofounders. And the m.o. for getting both is the same. Which leads to our sixth and last counterintuitive point: that the way to get startup ideas is not to try to [think of startup ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html).

If you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, the ideas you come up with will not merely be bad, but bad and plausible-sounding, meaning you'll waste a lot of time on them before realizing they're bad.

The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back. Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any conscious effort. In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even realize at first that they're startup ideas.

_“ The best startups almost have to start as side projects, because great ideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would reject them as ideas for companies.”_

#### How do you turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in unconsciously? 

**(1) Learn a lot about things that matter**
- [Power of Marginal](http://www.paulgraham.com/marginal.html)

**(2) Work on problems that interest you**
_"The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain expertise."_

**(3) With people you like and respect:**
_"At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for curiosity. And you'll do it best if you introduce the ulterior motive toward the end of the process."_

So here is the ultimate advice for young would-be startup founders, boiled down to two words: just learn.

## [How to get and evaluate startup ideas:](https://www.startupschool.org/curriculum/how-to-get-and-evaluate-startup-ideas):
### Most Common mistake with startup ideas:
#### Not solving a real problem:
- When you can articulate the problems but when talking to users they don’t care about the issue that it solves. Problem with this approach is you find a superficially plausible/ made up problem that people don’t care about. 

_“SISP: Solution in search for a problem”_

- Instead -> Fall in love with a problem.
- Start with a high quality problem (not abstract like Global poverty) which is specific.

#### Getting Stuck on a ‘Tarpit’ Idea:
- **Tarpit Idea:** Set of common startup idea that have been around for forever, when founders start working on these they don’t go anywhere like they are stick in tar.

- Cause of tarpit ideas:
    - Widespread problem that lots of potential founders encounter
    - Seems like it could be easily solvable with a startup
    - There's a structural reason why it's actually very difficult to solve

They are common ideas which are much harder than they seem.

- How to go about this:
  - Google it, see if this problem has being tried to be solved in the past. Find people and talk to them to understand the issues or th roadblocks they encountered

#### Not evaluating an Idea:
- Founders jump on the first idea they think will work, without studying the problem or if their product/service will make a good business.

#### Wait for the perfect idea:
- It’s the complete opposite, they wait all the time and never start anything. The correct startup idea has all the right qualities to morph into a great idea over time.

_“You should think of your initial idea as a good starting point. Startup ideas morph over time”_

### 10 Key Questions To Ask About A Startup Idea:
**1)	Do you have founder/market fit:**
- Are you the right team to be working on this idea, so if you are making a construction helper site, the cofounder should have some expertise about construction and webdev.
- It’s a good practice to pick a good idea for your team, so the startup idea you pitch will be something your team would be good at executing.
**2)	How big is the market:**
Two kinds of markets you should aim for:
-	Ones that are big now
-	Ones that are small but rapidly growing

**3)	How acute is this problem:**
Working on something that isn’t really a problem or something people don’t care about. 
The opposite to this is an idea which has no rivals or alternatives, like BREX it gives credit cards to startups (it had no competitiors and was the only company providing this service).

**4)	Do you have competition:**
- Most good startup ideas have competition, it sound wrong but it’s the truth. 
- The counter to this is if you are going against an entrenched competition you would typically need a new insight.

**5)	Do you want this or know people who want this:**

**6)	Did this only recently become possible or necessary:**
- Something has been recently changed like a new technology or a regulatory change or a new problem, this creates a new opportunity.

**7)	Are there good proxies for this business?**
- Proxy is a large company which does something similar to your startup, but it’s not a direct competitor. Its shows that the idea works and has not been implemented properly or has some issues.

Eg: Reginal food delivery beating Doordash, this is not because Doordash has a bad product it’s just that it didn’t capture the market in that particular area.

**8)	Is this an idea you’d like to work on for years?**

**9)	Is this a scalable business?**
- If your building software there is no issue as software scales infinitely but for services it’s a very important question (any business which requires high skill human labour to serve customers).

**10) Is this a good idea space?**
- _Idea space:_ One level of abstraction out from a particular startup idea, it’s a class of closely related startup ideas.

_“Different idea spaces have wildly different hit rates”_
- The aim is to find a good idea space which has a reasonable hit rate for new startup ideas and good founder market fit. By putting yourself in a good idea space, you put yourself in a good position to bump into a good startup idea.
