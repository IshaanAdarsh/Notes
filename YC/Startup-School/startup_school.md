## Should You Start A Startup?

**Need to be resilient:**
  - Being supremely confident is different (it helps), but resilience is more about being brave but to believe in your product or service even after facing criticism.

**Need enduring motivation:**
  - This can be achieved by working on a problem you are genuinely interested in and love the people you are working with. 

_"It's better to make a product that a few people really love than one a lot of people are indifferent towards."_

### What do I have to lose? 
Image the worst case scenario which can happen if you start-up, and decide if you live with that. You will need a year’s worth of data to understand if the start-up you are working on is promising.

But you will learn a lot when starting a new company, new connections and new perspective. This also shows that you can lead people and is very helpful in future career prospects. Need to do sales, product and customer support all at once. This can help you in identifying what work you enjoy and which field suits you.

### Identifying the startup idea:
First look for a co-founder who you can debate with and have a good rapport, then fleshout your fuzzy thoughts into proper ideas about the direction you want to take. Then you can turn these ideas into side projects -> “It will be cool if someone build X”. Then try to build X. If X can elicit a positive response in someone and it makes them change their way of going about their routine, you might be on to something.

## [WHY TO NOT NOT START A STARTUP](http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html)

## [Prepare yourself to start a startup:](http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html)
### Counterintuitive:
- Startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot of mistakes. Partners give counterintuitive ideas: they contradict your intuitions, which help you avoid mistakes most of the time.
- But trust your feeling about people.

_“If you're thinking about getting involved with someone — as a cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and you have misgivings about them, trust your gut. If someone seems slippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don't ignore it.
This is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent. Work with people you genuinely like, and you've known long enough to be sure.”_

### Expertise:
The way to succeed in a startup is not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users and the problem you're solving for them.

_“making something people want”_

### Game:
Being trained for their whole lives to play such games (learning the type of questions in a test but not about the subject to get a good grade), young founders' first impulse on starting a startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new game. 

_“ starting a startup is where gaming the system stops working.”_


### All-Consuming:
If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine. It never gets any easier. The nature of the problems change. But the total volume of worry never decreases; if anything it increases.

### Try:
If you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably shouldn't do it. But if you're merely unsure whether you're up to it, the only way to find out is to try. Just not now.

### Ideas:
There are only two things you need initially: an idea and cofounders. And the m.o. for getting both is the same. Which leads to our sixth and last counterintuitive point: that the way to get startup ideas is not to try to [think of startup ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html).

If you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, the ideas you come up with will not merely be bad, but bad and plausible-sounding, meaning you'll waste a lot of time on them before realizing they're bad.

The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back. Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any conscious effort. In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even realize at first that they're startup ideas.

_“ The best startups almost have to start as side projects, because great ideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would reject them as ideas for companies.”_

#### How do you turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in unconsciously? 

**(1) Learn a lot about things that matter**
- [Power of Marginal](http://www.paulgraham.com/marginal.html)

**(2) Work on problems that interest you**
_"The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain expertise."_

**(3) With people you like and respect:**
_"At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for curiosity. And you'll do it best if you introduce the ulterior motive toward the end of the process."_

So here is the ultimate advice for young would-be startup founders, boiled down to two words: just learn.

## [How to get and evaluate startup ideas:](https://www.startupschool.org/curriculum/how-to-get-and-evaluate-startup-ideas):
### Most Common mistake with startup ideas:
#### Not solving a real problem:
- When you can articulate the problems but when talking to users they don’t care about the issue that it solves. Problem with this approach is you find a superficially plausible/ made up problem that people don’t care about. 

_“SISP: Solution in search for a problem”_

- Instead -> Fall in love with a problem.
- Start with a high quality problem (not abstract like Global poverty) which is specific.

#### Getting Stuck on a ‘Tarpit’ Idea:
- **Tarpit Idea:** Set of common startup idea that have been around for forever, when founders start working on these they don’t go anywhere like they are stick in tar.

- Cause of tarpit ideas:
    - Widespread problem that lots of potential founders encounter
    - Seems like it could be easily solvable with a startup
    - There's a structural reason why it's actually very difficult to solve

They are common ideas which are much harder than they seem.

- How to go about this:
  - Google it, see if this problem has being tried to be solved in the past. Find people and talk to them to understand the issues or th roadblocks they encountered

#### Not evaluating an Idea:
- Founders jump on the first idea they think will work, without studying the problem or if their product/service will make a good business.

#### Wait for the perfect idea:
- It’s the complete opposite, they wait all the time and never start anything. The correct startup idea has all the right qualities to morph into a great idea over time.

_“You should think of your initial idea as a good starting point. Startup ideas morph over time”_

### 10 Key Questions To Ask About A Startup Idea:
**1)	Do you have founder/market fit:**
- Are you the right team to be working on this idea, so if you are making a construction helper site, the cofounder should have some expertise about construction and webdev.
- It’s a good practice to pick a good idea for your team, so the startup idea you pitch will be something your team would be good at executing.
**2)	How big is the market:**
Two kinds of markets you should aim for:
-	Ones that are big now
-	Ones that are small but rapidly growing

**3)	How acute is this problem:**
Working on something that isn’t really a problem or something people don’t care about. 
The opposite to this is an idea which has no rivals or alternatives, like BREX it gives credit cards to startups (it had no competitiors and was the only company providing this service).

**4)	Do you have competition:**
- Most good startup ideas have competition, it sound wrong but it’s the truth. 
- The counter to this is if you are going against an entrenched competition you would typically need a new insight.

**5)	Do you want this or know people who want this:**

**6)	Did this only recently become possible or necessary:**
- Something has been recently changed like a new technology or a regulatory change or a new problem, this creates a new opportunity.

**7)	Are there good proxies for this business?**
- Proxy is a large company which does something similar to your startup, but it’s not a direct competitor. Its shows that the idea works and has not been implemented properly or has some issues.

Eg: Reginal food delivery beating Doordash, this is not because Doordash has a bad product it’s just that it didn’t capture the market in that particular area.

**8)	Is this an idea you’d like to work on for years?**

**9)	Is this a scalable business?**
- If your building software there is no issue as software scales infinitely but for services it’s a very important question (any business which requires high skill human labour to serve customers).

**10) Is this a good idea space?**
- _Idea space:_ One level of abstraction out from a particular startup idea, it’s a class of closely related startup ideas.

_“Different idea spaces have wildly different hit rates”_
- The aim is to find a good idea space with a reasonable hit rate for new startup ideas and good founder market fit. By putting yourself in a good idea space, you put yourself in a good position to bump into a good startup idea.

### Three things that make startup ideas seem bad, but make them good:
**1) Hard to get started:**
- [Schlep Blindness](http://www.paulgraham.com/schlep.html)
- This often happens when many people can see the problem but due to the steep learning curve and hard starting point people don't attempt the idea.
**2) Boring space:**
  - A boring problem doesn't mean you don't attempt to solve said problem, due to this these software have a much higher hit rate.
  - The day-to-day reality of a startup is the same for a boring or an interesting idea.
**3) Existing competitors:**
  - There is a real change that most people don't use the competitors products and there is a problem which is to be solved.

## 7 Recipes for Generating Startup Ideas
### How to come up with Startup ideas originally(long game):
- Become an expert on something valuable
- Work at a startup
- Build things you find interesting

### 1) Start with what your team is really good at and think of ideas which take advantage of your expertise
- These have automatic founder/market fit.

### 2) Start with a problem you have personally encountered
- Ideally one problem which you are in an unusual position to see.

#### Using Recipes One and Two
- Think of every job you've had (+ internships + life experiences).
- What are problems or opportunities you've been in a special position to see?

### 3) Think of things you personally wish existed:
- Most dangerous and could lead to tarpit ideas.
- To avoid this research and see why this thing doesn't exist yet.
### 4) Look for things in the world that have changed recently and created a new opportunity
### 5) Look for new variants of successful companies
### 6) Talk to people and ask what problems they have:
- To do this pick a fertile idea space and talk to people(founders and potential customers) in this idea space
### 7) Look for big industries that seem broken
### 8) Find a co-founder that has an idea

## [Pivoting Out of a Tarpit Idea](https://www.startupschool.org/curriculum/pivoting-out-of-a-tarpit-idea)
### Tarpit idea:
- Ideas that look innovative but are hard to execute. It's like a bucket of water in a desert, the people who find it generally discount the number of dead bodies near the bucket and go for the poisoned water.
- You will be defensive about this idea when you are presented with proof that this idea is challenging.

#### Consumer Ideas:
- Most tarpit ideas are consumer ideas, not aimed at companies
- This is because we have been marketed ideas all our life, so when we think of ideas we generally get consumer-centric ideas.(like facebook and google)

**Challenges to implement consumer products:**
- The bar is high (they discount the failures)
- Timing is very important

#### Supply and Demand:
- Best way to see the startup ecosystem is to look for ideas which have
    - *A low supply of founders:* Founders with expertise in a particular field not like social media apps which everyone wants to make
    - *High demand in niche markets:* Like mining software which guides the machinery where and what to send to maximize profit.

## All About Pivoting:
### What is pivot:
- If you are very very early stage it's not even exactly "pivoting" - it is just idea iteration - "pivoting" usually implies changing a product that is fully live and has customers (for example, Slack)
- Pivoting is not a big bang moment - it's just a thing you do when you iterate on ideas - it's a lightweight thing
- A company that is not quickly ideating and rapidly learning and changing assumptions, in the beginning, is probably not moving fast enough

### Why you should pivot:
#### Opportunity cost: 
*"the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen."*
- If you are working on something that isn't working and you have evidence that its not working you are taking oppertunity cost by not working on something else.

### Reasons to Pivot
| Good Reasons Not to Pivot                                  | Good Reasons to Pivot                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| • You are trying to run away from doing hard work           | • I hate working on it                                         |
| • You are repeatedly changing ideas and giving up on them before launching and doing sales | • It's not growing                                           |
| • You read an article about some hot new trend that is popular with investors and want to chase it | • I'm not a good fit to be working on this idea              |
|                                                           | • I am relying on an external factor outside of my control to make my startup take off |
|                                                           | • I'm out of ideas on what to do differently to make it start working |

### Why people take too long to pivot:
#### Loss aversion:
- When you put a lot of time into something, you have a hard time letting go of it

#### Have a little bit of traction:
- Have a few users, but not hitting something new. (maybe it will work)

#### People are polite and have a hard time telling you they don't want what you are making in a direct way
#### Fear of admitting weakness/defeat (watch out for this you asshole)
#### Putting blame re:why things aren't working on customers/investors (I'm not wrong the world is wrong)
#### Inspiration Porn:
- Belief given to you by inspirational sources that *"if you just believe hard enough things are going to change"*

### Product Market Fit:
- Most people never get it
- **You know you have it when growth is not your biggest problem - keeping up with demand is**
- If you don't have PMF and you have given an idea your best then it can be easier to get PMF by changing ideas than continuing to throw good time/money after bad look at it like *"shots on goal"* by pivoting you het  more shots and probably will score.

### Finding a Better idea:
- Try to find something the founders are more excited about and makes them feel more optimistic to work on it
  - Corollary: being more ambitious is often counter-intuitively easier (going after harder ideas is good)
- Honest assessment of founders strengths/weaknesses and attempt to find something with better founder market-fit (Self awareness)
- Best to find something easy to get started and validate market feedback (for a pivot)

#### It's OK to not work an idea that requires venture capital:
- Most companies in the world that people start don't require VC. That is good.
- Trying to raise money for a company where VC doesn't make sense is not a great use of anyones time (if the idea is VC fundable)

_"If the way you evaluate the quality of an idea is from investors you are going to get pushed down the VC rabbit hole"_

### Venture vs non-venture scale ideas
- There is no guidebook I am aware of for what "venture scale means"
- Some suggestions I have:
  - Can I imagine this business possibly generating 100s of millions or billions in net revenue per year?
  - Can I imagine the revenue growth to get to that scale taking less than ten years?
  - Can I imagine this as a publicly traded company?
  - Technology is a key component, and the technology is built by the founders rather than outsourced
  -  Extremely high "software" margins (80% gross margin)
  -  A large % of stuff on Shark Tank is not a venture-backable business

**If yes then go for VC funding**

### When is the best time to pivot:
As soon as possible when these things happen:
- You have launched and have been trying to get users for weeks or months and it feels hopeless
- When the idea is impossible to get started on b/c it takes years of building/too much capital etc
- You know in your heart its not going to work
- Having employees while pivoting is extra hard and not recommended - best to do it with just founders

#### Whiplash:
- Pivoting over and over and over again can cause whiplash
  - Whiplash makes founders give up -> kills the company

_"Founders that are incapable of changing ideas struggle, founders that change ideas too much struggle. Find the happy medium"_

### Where Do Great Startup Ideas Come From?
There are 3 common themes:
- **Timing**
  - Preexisting Product
  - Preexisting Competitor
  - 10x Better Product Possible
 
- **Idea**
  - Most founders and investors thought these ideas were horrible
 
- **Market**
  - Each opportunity turned out to be bigger than what the founders expected
