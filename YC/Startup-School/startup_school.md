## Should You Start A Startup?

**Need to be resilient:**
  - Being supremely confident is different (it helps), but resilience is more about being brave but to believe in your product or service even after facing criticism.

**Need enduring motivation:**
  - This can be achieved by working on a problem you are genuinely interested in and love the people you are working with. 

_"It's better to make a product that a few people really love than one a lot of people are indifferent towards."_

### What do I have to lose? 
Image the worst case scenario which can happen if you start-up, and decide if you live with that. You will need a year’s worth of data to understand if the start-up you are working on is promising.

But you will learn a lot when starting a new company, new connections and new perspective. This also shows that you can lead people and is very helpful in future career prospects. Need to do sales, product and customer support all at once. This can help you in identifying what work you enjoy and which field suits you.

### Identifying the startup idea:
First look for a co-founder who you can debate with and have a good rapport, then fleshout your fuzzy thoughts into proper ideas about the direction you want to take. Then you can turn these ideas into side projects -> “It will be cool if someone build X”. Then try to build X. If X can elicit a positive response in someone and it makes them change their way of going about their routine, you might be on to something.

### Counterintuitive:
- Startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot of mistakes. Partners give counterintuitive ideas: they contradict your intuitions, which help you avoid mistakes most of the time.
- But trust your feeling about people.

_“If you're thinking about getting involved with someone — as a cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and you have misgivings about them, trust your gut. If someone seems slippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don't ignore it.
This is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent. Work with people you genuinely like, and you've known long enough to be sure.”_

### Expertise:
The way to succeed in a startup is not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users and the problem you're solving for them.

_“making something people want”_

### Game:
Being trained for their whole lives to play such games (learning the type of questions in a test but not about the subject to get a good grade), young founders' first impulse on starting a startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new game. 

_“ starting a startup is where gaming the system stops working.”_


### All-Consuming:
If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine. It never gets any easier. The nature of the problems change. But the total volume of worry never decreases; if anything it increases.

### Try:
If you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably shouldn't do it. But if you're merely unsure whether you're up to it, the only way to find out is to try. Just not now.
