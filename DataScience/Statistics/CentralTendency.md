# Measure of Centre:
- Affected by 
  - x
  - /
  - +
  - (-)
## Mode:
- The mode is the value or values that appear most frequently in a dataset.

## Median:
- The median is the middle value in an ordered dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. 
- It divides the dataset into two equal halves. 

## Mean:
- The mean, also known as the average, is calculated by summing all the values in a dataset and dividing the sum by the number of observations. 
- It represents the arithmetic center of the dataset.

# Measure of Spread:
- Affected by 
  - x
  - /

## Range:
- Range = Max - Min

## Standard Deviation:

- Standard deviation is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a dataset. 
- It provides a measure of how spread out the values are around the mean of the dataset. 
- Low SD  -> Low spread
- High SD -> Large Spread

# Outliers: 
- Outliers are data points that significantly differ from the other values in a dataset. 
- They can be exceptionally high or low values that lie far away from the majority of the data points. 
- Outliers Affect: 
  - Mean
  - Range 
  - Standard Deviation / Variance

# Five-number summary:

1. Minimum: The minimum is the smallest value in the dataset. It represents the lower boundary of the data.

2. First Quartile (Q1): The first quartile is the median of the lower half of the data. It divides the dataset into two equal parts, with 25% of the data falling below it and 75% above it. It is also known as the 25th percentile.

3. Median (Q2): The median is the middle value of the dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. It represents the central tendency of the data and divides the dataset into two equal parts. It is also known as the 50th percentile or the second quartile.

4. Third Quartile (Q3): The third quartile is the median of the upper half of the data. It divides the dataset into two equal parts, with 75% of the data falling below it and 25% above it. It is also known as the 75th percentile.

5. Maximum: The maximum is the largest value in the dataset. It represents the upper boundary of the data.

## Percentile:
- Percentiles are statistical measures that divide a dataset into equal parts. 
- They represent the values below which a certain percentage of the data falls.
