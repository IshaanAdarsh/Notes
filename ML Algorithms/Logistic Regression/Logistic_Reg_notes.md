# Classification Problems:
- In this the output varibale y can take only a handful number of variables unlike linear regression where infinite numbers are considered
- In these problems linear regression is not a good algoritm to classify these problems

## Binary Classification:
- Where there are only 2 ouptuts for y 
  - Negative Class (0->False)
  - Positive Class (1->True)
For Binary Classification, LR is not Optimal as:
- Even after setting a THreshold, if there are any outliers, it causes issues

## Logistical Regression:
- For binary classification, logistical regression is used, it a type of classification

### Sigmoid Funtion and its use in Logistical Regression:
-  The logistic function in linear regression is a type of sigmoid, a class of functions with the same specific properties. Sigmoid is a mathematical function that takes any real number and maps it to a probability between 1 and 0.
