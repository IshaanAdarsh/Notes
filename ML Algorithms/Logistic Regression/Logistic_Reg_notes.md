# Classification Problems:
- In this the output varibale y can take only a handful number of variables unlike linear regression where infinite numbers are considered
- In these problems linear regression is not a good algoritm to classify these problems

## Binary Classification:
- Where there are only 2 ouptuts for y 
  - Negative Class (0->False)
  - Positive Class (1->True)
For Binary Classification, LR is not Optimal as:
- Even after setting a THreshold, if there are any outliers, it causes issues
