## Introduction to Balance Sheet:
- A Balance Sheet is an overview of what the comapny owns(left) and what a company owes(right) at a point in time. The balance sheet gives us information about the assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity.
- The balance sheet is prepared on a flow basis, meaning, it has financial information about the company right from the time it was incorporated. It discusses how the company has evolved financially over the years.

### Conceptual Level working of a Balance sheet:
- **Current Assets:**
  - Cash and other assets which are expected to be converted to cash within a year
  - Assets are listed form Most Liquid (top) to least liquid (Bottom)
- **Non-Current Assets:**
  - Long term investments that can't be converted to cash quickly

- **Current Liabilites:**
  - Amounts due to be paid to creditors within twelve months
  - Liabilities are listed form Due First (top) to Due Last (bottom)
- **Non-Current Liabilities:**
  - Longer term laibilities to be paid after the period of one year
  - Total Liability = Shareholdersâ€™ Funds + Non-Current Liabilities + Current Liabilities
- **Equity:**
  - Book Value of the shareholder capital
    - Share Capital = FV * Number of shares Therefore,
    - Number of shares = Share Capital / FV

## Total Assets = Total liabilities + Total equity
